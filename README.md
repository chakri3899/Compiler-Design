**Compiler Design**
In this repo, programs to implement different concepts of a compiler are present.

***Instructions to execute lexical analyser using lex tool in Command Prompt:***

   1. flex filename.l (This will create a lex.yy.c file)
   2. gcc lex.yy.c (This will create an executable file with name a)
   3. a.exe var.c (var.c is the name of file on which you wish to perform the lexical analysis. It can be any file with any name)

The file program.txt is the input file to the program lexical.c 
Similarly, var.c is the input file to the program lexical.l using lex tool.
